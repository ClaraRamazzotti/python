# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level programming language widely used in both industry and the academy. It is particularly suited to working with textual and numeric data, and has a strong developer community that enables Python programmers to leverage code that has already been written to solve many problems. Python emphasizes readability and comprehensibility, and its straightforward syntax makes it accessible as a first programming language.
