### Installation

For these exercises, we will be using ANaconda, a version of Python that comes packaged with useful libraries for working with natural language and scientific data. 

To download Anaconda, [follow this link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and click the button for your operating system and Python 3.x (3.5 at the time of this writing).

After installation, to test that ANaconda is working correctly, type 

    $ python --version

in your terminal. If Anaconda is working, your output should look like this:

	Python 3.5.1 :: Anaconda 2.5.0 (64-bit)

Note that to get this output you may need to refresh your terminal by typing `$SHELL` in the prompt (including the `$`) or by logging out and logging in again.
